## Welcome to @steembasicincome's twentieth member interview!

To provide more interaction within Steem Basic Income (SBI), we are continuing our interviews with prominent members of SBI! We hope to bring a greater sense of community, get to know our members, and gain a better understanding of why Steemians are choosing to be a part of SBI.

### Writer Intro: @wesphilbin

Greetings, again fellow Steemians, I am [@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin). This will be my twelfth interview for the Steem Basic Income group. I have interviewed the following Steemians: [@eturnerx](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-eturnerx) [@ecoinstant](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-ecoinstant) [@jonnyla08](https://steemit.com/interview/@steembasicincome/interview-with-jonnyla08) [@rishi556](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-rishi556) [@tattoodjay](https://steemit.com/interview/@steembasicincome/interview-with-tattoodjay) [@mariannewest](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-mariannewest) [@solominer](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/interview-with-solominer) [@r2cornell](https://steemit.com/palnet/@steembasicincome/interview-with-r2cornell) [@freedompoint](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/interview-with-freedompoint) [@shadowspub](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-shadowspub) [@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/sbi-member-interview-featuring-enginewitty)

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): Continuing to highlight our **Steem Basic Income** members... I had the pleasure of chatting with [@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon) recently, and I must say; this gentleman is the "perfect" example of not only supporting the **SBI** initiative, but also, providing numerous positive quality content on the _Blockchain_. Let's get right into it...

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): What an honor to finally meet you, my friend. You are involved in so many things on the _Blockchain_... would you mind telling our readers, a little about yourself? Get everyone up to speed on who is @contrabourdon?

[@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon): Thanks for picking me for this interview Wes! Well... where do I start? I joined **Steem** only in _February_ this year because I wanted to participate in an organ playing contest run by [@organduo](https://steemit.com/@organduo). I have known [@organduo](https://steemit.com/@organduo) for several years off the chain prior to this and we mostly conversed via email and **Facebook**. Our conversations were only about organ playing until I discovered the possibilities of the **Steem** _Blockchain_. So yes, I'm an organist (my passion) and working in **IT** is my job :stuck\_out\_tongue: I began only posting on **Steem** for the contest and I won it several times. I was also the recipient of a couple of [@curie](https://steemit.com/@curie) upvotes so I was on a high! I had dabbled in **Bitcoin** and other alts in the past, but I ended up dumping them because they didn't "do anything for me". So with this liquid **STEEM** in my wallet, I decided to do the same... was it worth anything? Well, back then it was about $0.40 and I ended up cashing out around the equivalent of $60 **AUD**. I was pretty stoked at making this by just entering contests and getting upvoted.

A few weeks more had passed and I started to post things other than my contest entries. I also started upvoting other posts but realised my vote was worth nothing. It was then I decided to invest and power up. If I was to be taken seriously on a platform, I had to show some sort of commitment! To cut a long story short, I got the "**STEEM** bug" and I was just hungry for more power! I used fiat to invest most of what is in my **SP** now and I have generated about 2.3k **SP** through author rewards (according to [@steemchiller](https://steemit.com/@steemchiller)). With my **IT** background, I was incredibly fascinated with the idea of a social platform that could be driven by code. I guess this is what kept me here. As for [@steembasicincome](https://steemit.com/@steembasicincome), I was initially sponsored by [@partitura](https://steemit.com/@partitura) (fellow organist friend) and it was great to get ongoing support on postsâ€”especially for a newbie trying to be noticed.

As [@organduo](https://steemit.com/@organduo) and I had already a common interest, I bugged him a lot with questions about **Steem** and slowly but surely, I started developing little things on the blockchain. The first project was the [@giphy](https://steemit.com/@giphy) bot. I love **GIF**'s and I wanted to bring it to the _Blockchain_. I sought permission from the company [**GIPHY**](https://giphy.com/) itself to use their name (and to also create a token)! And if we fast forward all the random little projects along the way, [@organduo](https://steemit.com/@organduo) and I decided to become a witnessâ€”[@untersatz](https://steemit.com/@untersatz). We are so grateful to all our supporters. It's hard to believe that in our short journey we are already ranked 88 (85 active)! Well... I know you said you wanted to know a little about myself, but I got a little carried away haha!

#### "One way to make people remember you - play ridiculously bad so that you cannot be forgotten. \[Witness: @untersatz] \[contrabourdon#9193]"

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): I knew you were involved in several things, but not at this level! You don't need to apologize either... this is all fascinating stuff! Do you have a hard time choosing between _Blockchain_ and your other endeavors?

[@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon): I can't remember all the things I've done myself! I really do need to document everything (and bot commands) so that fellow **Steemians** can use all my tools if they wish. I do have a hard time choosing between this and my other endeavors. I have a young family of three girls, with [@leysa](https://steemit.com/@leysa), a full-time job and a passion for music. I'm definitely spinning many plates. I try not to put too much pressure on myself. I do whatever has the priority first and everything else can wait.

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): Oh my goodness! Three girls? My fiancee and I enjoy children very much... they "keep it real ". My son is actually on the _Blockchain_ as well, but enjoys his **PS4** a little more lol...

So... you mentioned the [**GIPHY**](https://steemit.com/@giphy) Bot as well as other various projects. Is there anything new that's taking precedence you'd care to talk about? Conversely... would any of these projects be **SBI** related?

[@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon): Yes, oh my goodness! That's one way to put it. My life is busy but I do enjoy the variety of things I get to experience. It's funny how my wife [@leysa](https://steemit.com/@leysa) will tell me to stop the car so she can get out and take a photo for [@tobetada](https://steemit.com/@tobetada)'s #lovetheclouds contest. I've also actually documented all my activities (finally!) onto a website. Check it out at https://contrabourdon.steem.design/. It was actually good for me to do this because I've been meaning to do a "brain dump". Now that it's all out in the open, I feel I can relax for a bit... In terms of projects, I really just start these things on a whim. I've got a whole list of things I want to develop one day. Most of them probably won't get done, but I like to write it down so I can free up some space in my mind. I've thought about involving **SBI** into a little project but I can't think of anything right now. I think [@josephsavage](https://steemit.com/@josephsavage) has got it all covered!\

#### \*\*Writer Note\*\*: For another project that's run by @contrabourdon, check out his "\*Quick Trade Steem Engine Tokens\*" here: https://quicktrade.steem.design/&#x20;

Also... don't forget to check out his "Easy SBI Contest" which is now on it's 98th rotation!\

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): You sure have given me a lot of information my friend... our readers will surely enjoy reading your interview! Before I let you go, what are your thoughts for **STEEM**, **SBI**, and your projects, moving forward?

[@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon): It was great chatting with you Wes! Much appreciated to take the time to interview me, especially when we are in different timezones and on opposite sides of the world. Can I just say, I'm totally addicted to **Steem** and I finally have an outlet where I can share my work and potentially get some updoots! Moving forward, I hope that these downvote wars settle down because **SBI** is here to support the _community_ (and when I mean support, the updoots aren't outrageous enough to dispute the rewards). In regards to my projects, I really think too much about what comes next â€” today has enough troubles of its own!

### Interview Conclusion

\


I hadn't planned on another **Witness** interview, but after reading my interview with [@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/sbi-member-interview-featuring-enginewitty), and seeing @contrabourdons reply... well, see for yourself:

![](https://i.imgur.com/QQRrud6.png)\


So, I couldn't say no! I certainly hope you have enjoyed this interview with [@contrabourdon](https://steemit.com/@contrabourdon) and if you are wondering about what _"Updoot_" means, that's just a fancy way of saying _Upvote_...

Twenty total interviews for the [@steembasicincome](https://steempeak.com/@steembasicincome/) Group... and my twelfth to date, as a writer for the **SBI** Group... With each Steemian I interview, I see a similar vibe my friends... sharing the positive effects of promoting community, a greater sense of why these Steemians are choosing to participate in the _Steem Basic Income_ initiative... for not only themselves and their interaction on the block-chain, but also sharing the understanding of engagement, by sponsoring others. I thank you for sticking around, and reading yet another interview highlighting a prominant user involved in the _Steem Basic Income_ initiative. Appreciate your continued support, involvement, and community interaction.

#### Who will we see on the next Steem Basic Income interview?

Until then my friends...

_Wes_
