## Welcome to @steembasicincome's nineteenth member interview!

To provide more interaction within Steem Basic Income (SBI), we are continuing our interviews with prominent members of SBI! We hope to bring a greater sense of community, get to know our members, and gain a better understanding of why Steemians are choosing to be a part of SBI.

### Writer Intro: @wesphilbin

Greetings, again fellow Steemians, I am [@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin). This will be my ninth interview for the Steem Basic Income group. I have interviewed the following Steemians: [@eturnerx](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-eturnerx) [@ecoinstant](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-ecoinstant) [@jonnyla08](https://steemit.com/interview/@steembasicincome/interview-with-jonnyla08) [@rishi556](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-rishi556) [@tattoodjay](https://steemit.com/interview/@steembasicincome/interview-with-tattoodjay) [@mariannewest](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-mariannewest) [@solominer](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/interview-with-solominer) [@r2cornell](https://steemit.com/palnet/@steembasicincome/interview-with-r2cornell) [@freedompoint](https://steemit.com/community/@steembasicincome/interview-with-freedompoint) [@shadowspub](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-shadowspub)

### Subject Intro: @enginewitty

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): I have been off the radar as it were... dealing with my Multiple Sclerosis flare-ups, as well as some nasty upper respiratory issues, so do apologize for the lack of amplifying the awesome of our **Steem Basic Income** members. I am sure this gentleman needs no introduction, but to be fair, let's do that... shall we?

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): From his **Steem** page: _"Witness on the chain, to maintain the mainframe... better learn the name, I play like a chess game..."_ You may know him as [@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty), or maybe _"Witty aka 'X40L1N'"_... either way, he is a **Witness** on the _Blockchain_, and has been on said _Blockchain_ since _May_ of 2017. Let's dive in, and learn about _Witty_...

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): Would you mind telling our readers, a little about yourself... what brought you to the blockchain?

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): Above all, I'm Dad to several. That's been my primary 'job' for the last 20 years and I don't see that changing before I die! HA! As for finding my self here, on **Steem**, that's an interesting little tidbit. I was involved and fairly successful with an **MLM** company called _Empower Network_. Being a writer by trade, it just fit really well. I was looking to expand my own marketing base as I was having some decent success on a few blogs like **Tumblr**, and I came across **Steemit**.

I'd already been familiar with _cryptocurrency_, being an early adopter of **Bitcoin**, so I didn't pay much attention to that aspect. I signed up and didn't even touch it for almost 3 or 4 months. Then as I was watching a few alts on Coin Market Cap, I saw **STEEM** being stable so figured I would check into it. Turns out, I was already here! So, what brought me here and why I'm still here - two different avenues now.

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): I'm curious... what was the reason you decided to become a **Witness**?

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): Why did I become a **Witness**? I don't like red tape, and I see a lot of that. I think with the proper leadership, this _Blockchain_ has the capacity to literally change the world as we know it. Right now, it's infested with greed - which is part of the reason the price of **STEEM** hasn't risen back up to a lovable level.

#### "The \*\*SBI\*\* model is one of the few that is truly sustainable by actually giving to receive - and you know how I am about that!"

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): I think I first met you at the _Pimp Your Post Thursday_, with [@shadowspub](https://steemit.com/interviews/@steembasicincome/interview-with-shadowspub)... this **MLM** company... **Empower Network**, can you share more with our readers about this... are you still there?

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): **EN - Empower Network**. We did probably the biggest prebuild for an **MLM** triangle **Facebook** had ever seen at the time. This was before they were ghosting people's posts and an ad you paid for was actually seen. We called it the _Beast_. In all honesty, I was never really in it for the marketing and building aspect as I was so much that I was finally getting paid something for writing a little here and there. Like virtually all _Network Marketing_ companies - it started to get stale and I had to move on.

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): I know the ghosting posts is a real thing, as well as _Shadow Banning_. Sorry to hear it didn't work out. So are you still involved with **Tumblr**? Or just strictly **"Steem"** related avenues?

\


[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): LOL no, haven't made a post on there since I joined **Steem**, pretty much. Every now and then I 'share' some content over there and push an article over that way but - it's probably been a year since I last did that. I pretty much threw everything else out the window and created a whole new foothold on **Steem**. I mean, people on **Facebook** are like, "What the fuck is **Bitcoin**?"... and since that was one of the larger 'recruiting' pools, I didn't see any point trying to push an agenda and creating time to again 'be ghosted'. You know **Facebook** has a strict policy against other _cryptocurrencies_, right? Pansies.

That doesn't mean I don't make it known. My profile picture over there is me wearing a **Steem** T-Shirt. I updated all my **LinkedIn** info to reflect my **Steem** relation and have a few accounts on **Twitter** that honor the _Blockchain_. I believe [@jackmiller](https://steemit.com/@jackmiller) has it set up on our budding website [thealliance.io](http://www.thealliance.io/) where it auto-tweets an article someone writes. So we have a cross platform presence, I just don't think the general populace has accepted _cryptocurrency_ yet. Hell, there's people who still ride horses, cook over an open flame and write letters.

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): There are many that still don't know about _cryptocurrency_, my friend. Or, if they do... scared of it perhaps. I'm curious; where did you first learn about **SBI**?

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): It was [@mariannewest](https://steemit.com/@mariannewest) that first introduced me to it. I really didn't pay much attention and believe I was one of the first 40 or 50 to be sponsored. She just said I'm gonna sponsor you and thank me later. Then at **The Block Party**, I got to meet her and we had a live video conference with [@josephsavage](https://steemit.com/@josephsavage) and it was awesome.\


[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): Oh yes!! I remember @mariannewest talking about this when I interviewed her... what a wonderful person she is! Slightly jealous you got to meet not only [@mariannewest](https://steemit.com/@mariannewest), but also [@josephsavage](https://steemit.com/@josephsavage); definitely two people that bring positive energy to the _Blockchain_. With the continued growth of the [thealliance.io](http://www.thealliance.io/) , are you utilizing **SBI** in any contests or challenges? I'd love for our readers who might not know of [**The Alliance**](https://steemit.com/@thealliance) to have the chance to learn what you are doing for the _Blockchain_, as well as the many other communities...\


[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): The website is still in its youth and I have to give a heavy thanks to [@sayee](https://steemit.com/@sayee) and [@latino.romano](https://steemit.com/@latino.romano) for being so consistent with steady content flow. Also a big thank you to [@jackmiller](https://steemit.com/@jackmiller) for keeping tabs on it.

As for contests? Every couple weeks I'll drop a question in one of my posts for people to comment a certain thing and hand out **SBI** for it. Think the last one was your favorite bug ðŸ˜‹ I also throw some out from time to time for other contests. A couple weeks ago I threw some into one held by [@innerblocks](https://steemit.com/@innerblocks) over there with [@freedompoint](https://steemit.com/@freedompoint) and [@freedomtowrite](https://steemit.com/@freedomtowrite). I also pick a random Sunday each month to throw **SBI** out to people that come to our family meetings. I don't publicize it because like with my own blog, I want people to actually read it or be there and stumble on it. With the meetings, I don't want them to think I'm paying them to be there but rather, a thank you for coming this time.

I used to loudly profess all the things I delegate to or support, but actions speak, ya know? One of our main focuses right now in the fam, is retention. Those that want to be here on chain. We ask a commitment and in return, commit to them. Win, win. We don't force you to write or make comments, but we appreciate it. If a person chooses to do a thing, it gets noticed. Simple as that :sunglasses:

#### "Right now, we have a #spreadlovenotwar campaign we started with a former bidbot. With the help of @contrabourdon, we turned it into a curation account and have a small whitelist of allies that can activate it on chain. Pretty neat, actually. We tend to focus on undervalued posts and great content. We just made it possible for the account to resteem anything we vote on so whoever reads this and wants to see the kinds of things our curators are looking at, follow @alliedforces ðŸ’ª "

\


[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): You know, I think it's wonderful that you are setting such a positive example. Interacting with so many members and communities... I have to ask; considering all this _"New Steem"_ mindset, do you feel what you are providing via **SBI** units is still a positive addition? I certainly do, but I am curious of your thoughts. In the same context, do you feel more pressure representing **SBI** while holding the responsibility of being a **Witness?**

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): **#newsteem**, pssh. It's the same blockchain man! And did you know the rewards have been 50/50 before? I have chameleon properties though, or maybe ninja, so it's easy to adapt to changes for me. I don't always agree or like them, but I find a way. As for **SBI** being a positive addition? **Hecks ya**! People can't **BOT** their posts anymore so they need that little extra boost. The **SBI** model is one of the few that is truly sustainable by actually giving to receive - and you know how I am about that! As for being a **Witness** in reference to **SBI**? I hold no accountability to to any organization other than my own family here that I've been cultivating and nurturing.

Sure, I love other ones. For example, I am a frequent visitor to the shows in **The Ramble** that [@shadowspub](https://steemit.com/@shadowspub) puts on. When I remember, I try to check out the [@freewritehouse](https://steemit.com/@freewritehouse) and [@heyhaveyamet](https://steemit.com/@heyhaveyamet) peoples. I mingle with the _Veterans_ and my Pirate stakkers, gamers, musicians, you name it. The only responsibility I feel is to everyone that wants to see this _Blockchain_ still onboarding new users in 20 years. That's why I became a **Witness**. The potential here is unmatched by any other chain and I really care about it, even though I'm no master coder or developer. What we build now, our kids will see. I want to give them a castle :wink:

[@wesphilbin](https://steemit.com/@wesphilbin): Oh yes... I see you everywhere, my friend! I remember when I first heard of **The Alliance**... I was always looking to see how things went, and learned about everything you stood for; family, friends, positive content on the _Blockchain_; it is appreciated... before I let you get back to **Witnessing** (is that a word?) I am curious of your thoughts on **STEEM**, **Steem**, **SBI** moving forward...

[@enginewitty](https://steemit.com/@enginewitty): Moving forward, I see a bright future for those that remain here on chain and stick out this #newsteem nonsense. It never changed, it's the same **Steem** I joined over 2 years ago except, there's a few different protocols now. If I was a _consensus_ **Witness**, I would have voted against several things, but it is what it is and this marathon is far from over. How about you Wes, you gonna run with me?

Yes, my friend... I will be right beside you...

***

Nineteen total interviews for the [@steembasicincome](https://steempeak.com/@steembasicincome/) Group... and my eleventh to date, as a writer for the **SBI** Group... With each Steemian I interview, I see a similar vibe my friends... sharing the positive effects of promoting community, a greater sense of why these Steemians are choosing to participate in the _Steem Basic Income_ initiative... for not only themselves and their interaction on the block-chain, but also sharing the understanding of engagement, by sponsoring others. I thank you for sticking around, and reading yet another interview highlighting a prominant user involved in the _Steem Basic Income_ initiative. Appreciate your continued support, involvement, and community interaction.

#### Who will we see on the next Steem Basic Income interview?

Until then my friends...

_Wes_
