# ðŸ’¡ How Does it Work?

A pending vote value is tracked for every enrolled account. Every 2.4 hours, we increase your pending upvote value, based on your unit levels, at a per unit rate that we have determined to be sustainable.&#x20;

Each time an enrolled account posts, we check whether the account has accumulated enough pending vote value to support an upvote. It takes a pending balance of $0.063 to deliver our minimum upvote of $0.021, but we start every new member with enough pending vote value to receive their first upvote right away.&#x20;

After your first upvote, the time until your next upvote depends on how long it takes to â€˜rechargeâ€™ the pending vote value that was already delivered and bring your pending value above $0.063 again.
