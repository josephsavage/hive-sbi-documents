# ✨ What Should You Do?

\
You don’t have to do anything - as long as your account is in good standing, you will receive regular upvotes as often as your pending vote value grows enough.&#x20;

#### There are things you can do that will improve your SBI experience.

* Start by sending a ‘thank you’ to the account that enrolled you. That initial subscription will stack with any future enrollments and increase the regularity or size of the upvotes delivered to you. You can see the accounts that have supported you here: [https://www.hivesbi.com/transaction-history/sponsored-hive-SBI/?user=mastergerund](https://www.hivesbi.com/transaction-history/sponsored-hive-SBI/?user=mastergerund) (just change 'user' to your name in the search box)
* Consider upvoting [@steembasicincome](https://peakd.com/@steembasicincome) or its official accounts ([@sbi2](https://peakd.com/@sbi2), [@sbi3](https://peakd.com/@sbi3), [@sbi4](https://peakd.com/@sbi4), [@sbi5](https://peakd.com/@sbi5), [@sbi6](https://peakd.com/@sbi6), [@sbi7](https://peakd.com/@sbi7), [@sbi8](https://peakd.com/@sbi8), [@sbi9](https://peakd.com/@sbi9), [@sbi10](https://peakd.com/@sbi10), [@sbi-booster](https://peakd.com/@sbi-booster)). We do not reward users directly for upvoting our content, but boosting our HP levels will help us keep reward accrual rates high!
* Follow [@steembasicincome](https://peakd.com/@steembasicincome) and [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Z5KVQ5whKR) to stay informed.
* If you have available resources, decide whether your Hive commitment justifies an investment in lifetime upvotes. If you’re not sure, try a delegation first - the return is consistently higher than self-voting with the same SP and you can always recall the ‘investment’ if you decide you are unsatisfied.
* If you lack available resources, decide whether crowdfunding your own support base would get you the upvotes you crave. We have many members that receive meaningful daily upvotes just through regularly entering contests and upvoting our updates.
